# Financial-Sankey-StoryTeller

## Description
This project is designed to parse large financial documents into JSON files of just the income statements. The idea is to find the context and "story" of what the data shows and use an LLM to explain it.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React & Vite & TypeScript + recharts
- **Middleware**: FastAPI & CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)
- **Backend**: Python & PyMuPDF
- **LLMS**: Granite 3.3  & 3.2-vision


### Specific Use Case
- Vite: Open Source React and TypeScript Packaged Framework
- React: Javascript Framework, easy to use
- Typescript: Has everything about Javascript and more, and free!
- FastAPI: For connection between front and back-end
- CORS: For cross communication handling file upload between front to back then front again.
- Python: Good for integration of libraries for this project
- PyMuPDF: Helps with accessing and parsing the PDF document
- Granite 3.3: Works well with 3.2-vision model, used for story generation.
- Granite 3.2-vision: Specifically fine-tuned for documents and looking at charts, graphs, and such. Used for creating a JSON and getting the income statement.
